- [GNU Nettle >= v3.2](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/)


<a name="requirements"></a> Requirements
-----------------------------------------------


### Resolver
Add the directive `resolver A.B.C.D;` to your NGINX configuration file in the http section. This is required so NGINX can resolve the PerimeterX API DNS name.

### Lua Package Path
Update your lua package path location in the HTTP section of your configuration to reflect where you have installed the modules.

```
lua_package_path "/usr/local/lib/lua/?.lua;;";
```

### Lua CA Certificates
To support TLS to the collector you must point Lua to the trusted certificate location (actual location may differ between Linux distributions)

```
lua_ssl_trusted_certificate "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt";
lua_ssl_verify_depth 3;
```

In CentOS/RHEL systems the CA bundle location may be located at `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

### Lua Timer Initialization
Add the init by lua script.

```
init_worker_by_lua_file "/usr/local/lib/lua/px/utils/pxtimer.lua";
```

<a name="installation"></a> Installation
----------------------------------------

Installation can be done using [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/)

```sh
$ luarocks install perimeterx-nginx-plugin
```

Or by downoading the sources for this repository and run `sudo make install`

### <a name="basic-usage"></a> Basic Usage Example

To apply the PerimeterX enforcement add the following line in your location block.

`access_by_lua_file /usr/local/lib/lua/px/pxnginx.lua;`

Below is a complete example of nginx.conf containing the required directives and with enforcement applied to the location block /.

#### nginx.conf
```
worker_processes  1;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    lua_package_path "/usr/local/lib/lua/?.lua;;";

    # -- initializing the perimeterx module -- #
    init_worker_by_lua_file "/usr/local/lib/lua/px/utils/pxtimer.lua";

    lua_ssl_trusted_certificate "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt";
    lua_ssl_verify_depth 3;

    resolver 8.8.8.8;

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            #----- PerimeterX protect location -----#
            access_by_lua_file /usr/local/lib/lua/px/pxnginx.lua;
            #----- PerimeterX Module End  -----#

            root   /nginx/www;
            index  index.html;
        }
    }
}
```

### Extracting the real IP address from a request

> Note: IP extraction, according to your network setup, is very important. It is common to have a load balancer/proxy on top of your applications, in which case the PerimeterX module will send the system's internal IP as the user's. In order to properly perform processing and detection on server-to-server calls, the PerimeterX module requires the user's real IP address.

For the NGINX module to work with the real user's IP you need to set the `set_real_ip_from` NGINX directive in your nginx.conf, this will make sure the socket IP used in nginx is not coming from one of the network levels below it.

example:
```
  set_real_ip_from 172.0.0.0/8;
  set_real_ip_from 107.178.0.0/16;	
 ```

### <a name="configuration"></a> Configuration Options

#### Configuring Required Parameters

Configuration options are set in the file `/usr/local/lib/lua/px/pxconfig.lua`:

#### Required parameters:

- px_appId
- cookie_secret
- auth_token

#### <a name="blocking-score"></a> Changing the Minimum Score for Blocking

**Default blocking value:** 70

```
_M.blocking_score = 60
```

#### <a name="monitoring-mode"></a> Monitoring Mode
By default the PerimeterX module will block users crossing the block score threshold you define, meaning, if a user crosses the minimum block score he will receive the block page. The PerimeterX plugin can also be activated in monitor only mode.
Setting the block_enalbed flag to false will prevent the block page from being displayed to the user, but the data will still be available in the PerimeterX Portal.

```
_M.block_enabled = false
```
Disabling blocking means users crossing the blocking threshold will not be activly blocked, but you will still be able to consume their score through a custom request header `X-PX-SCORE`.

#### <a name="captcha-support"></a>Enable/Disable CAPTCHA on the block page

By enabling CAPTCHA support, a CAPTCHA will be served as part of the block page, giving real users the ability to identify as a human. By solving the CAPTCHA, the user's score is then cleaned up and the user is allowed to continue.

**Default: true**

```
_M.captcha_enabled = false
```


#### <a name="enabled-routes"></a> Enabled Routes

The enabled routes variable allow you to implicitly define a set of routes which the plugin will be active on. Supplying an empty list will set all application routes as active.

**Default: Empty list (all routes)**

```php
_M.enabled_routes = {'/blockhere'}
```


#### <a name="api-timeout"></a>API Timeout Milliseconds
> Note: Controls the timeouts for PerimeterX requests. The API is called when a Risk Cookie does not exist, or is expired or invalid.

API Timeout in milliseconds (float) to wait for the PerimeterX server API response.

**Default:** 1000

```
_M.s2s_timeout = 250
```

#### <a name="send-page-activities"></a> Send Page Activities

Boolean flag to enable or disable sending of activities and metrics to PerimeterX on each page request. Enabling this feature will provide data that populates the PerimeterX portal with valuable information such as the amount of requests blocked and additional API usage statistics.

**Default:** false

```php
_M.send_page_requested_activity = false
```

#### <a name="debug-mode"></a> Debug Mode

Enables debug logging mode.

**Default:** false

```
_M.px_debug = true
```

<a name="whitelisting"></a> Whitelisting
-----------------------------------------------
Whitelisting (bypassing enforcement) is configured in the file `/usr/local/lib/lua/px/utils/pxfilter.lua`

There are three types of filters that can be configured.

* Full URI
* URI prefix
* IP addresses

<a name="nginxplus"></a> NGINX Plus
-----------------------------------------------
The PerimeterX NGINX module is compatible with NGINX Plus. Users or administrators should install the NGINX Plus Lua dynamic module (LuaJIT).

<a name="contributing"></a> Contributing
----------------------------------------
The following steps are welcome when contributing to our project.
###Fork/Clone
First and foremost, [Create a fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the repository, and clone it locally.
Create a branch on your fork, preferably using a self descriptive branch name.

###Code/Run
Code your way out of your mess, and help improve our project by implementing missing features, adding capabilites or fixing bugs.

To run the code, simply follow the steps in the [installation guide](#installation). Grab the keys from the PerimeterX Portal, and try refreshing your page several times continously. If no default behaviours have been overriden, you should see the PerimeterX block page. Solve the CAPTCHA to clean yourself and start fresh again.

Feel free to check out the [Example App](https://nginx-sample-app.perimeterx.com), to have a feel of the project.

###<a name="tests"></a>Test
> Tests for this project are written using the [`Test::Nginx`](https://github.com/openresty/test-nginx) testing framework.
